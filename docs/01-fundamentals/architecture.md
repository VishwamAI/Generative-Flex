## Introduction

The architecture of modern generative AI systems is primarily based on the Transformer architecture, introduced in the landmark paper "Attention Is All You Need" (Vaswani et al., 2017). This architecture revolutionized machine learning by demonstrating that attention mechanisms alone could replace traditional recurrent and convolutional neural networks, leading to more efficient and effective models.

## Core Components

### 1. Attention Mechanisms

#### Self-Attention
- Allows the model to weigh the importance of different parts of the input
- Computes relationships between all positions in a sequence
- Key components:
  * Query (Q): What we're looking for
  * Key (K): What we match against
  * Value (V): What we extract
  * Attention formula: Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax(QK^T/√d_k)V

#### Multi-Head Attention
- Performs attention multiple times in parallel
- Allows the model to focus on different aspects of information
- Typically uses 8-16 attention heads
- Each head can learn different types of relationships

### 2. Encoder

- Purpose: Processes and transforms input data into meaningful representations
- Structure:
  * Multiple identical layers stacked together
  * Each layer contains:
    - Multi-head self-attention mechanism
    - Feed-forward neural network
    - Layer normalization
    - Residual connections
- Maintains bidirectional context

### 3. Decoder

- Purpose: Generates output based on encoded representations
- Structure:
  * Multiple identical layers stacked together
  * Each layer contains:
    - Masked multi-head self-attention
    - Multi-head attention over encoder output
    - Feed-forward neural network
    - Layer normalization
    - Residual connections
- Uses causal masking to prevent looking at future tokens

### 4. Feed-Forward Networks

- Purpose: Process information independently at each position
- Structure:
  * Two linear transformations with ReLU activation
  * First transformation expands dimension
  * Second transformation reduces dimension back
- Formula: FFN(x) = max(0, xW₁ + b₁)W₂ + b₂

### 5. Layer Normalization

- Purpose: Stabilizes the learning process
- Applied before attention and feed-forward layers
- Normalizes input across features
- Helps maintain consistent scale of activations
- Includes learnable parameters for scaling and bias

### 6. Positional Encoding

- Purpose: Adds position information to input embeddings
- Options:
  * Sinusoidal position encodings
  * Learned position embeddings
- Enables the model to understand sequence order
- Maintains spatial/temporal relationships

## Implementation Considerations

### Scaling Factors

1. Model Dimensions
   - Hidden size (typically 512-2048)
   - Number of attention heads (8-16)
   - Number of layers (6-24)
   - Feed-forward dimension (typically 4x hidden size)

2. Training Considerations
   - Dropout rates
   - Learning rate schedule
   - Warmup steps
   - Batch size

### Key Features

1. Parallelization
   - Allows for efficient training
   - Supports batch processing
   - Enables distributed computing

2. Memory Usage
   - Attention complexity: O(n²) with sequence length
   - Memory-efficient implementations
   - Gradient checkpointing options

## Advanced Concepts

### Attention Patterns

1. Global Attention
   - Full attention across all positions
   - Used in standard transformer

2. Local Attention
   - Restricted attention window
   - More efficient for long sequences

3. Sparse Attention
   - Selective attention patterns
   - Reduces computational complexity

### Model Variations

1. Encoder-only Models (e.g., BERT)
   - Bidirectional attention
   - Good for understanding tasks

2. Decoder-only Models (e.g., GPT)
   - Unidirectional attention
   - Efficient for generation tasks

3. Encoder-Decoder Models
   - Full transformer architecture
   - Ideal for sequence-to-sequence tasks
